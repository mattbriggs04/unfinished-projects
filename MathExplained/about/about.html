            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <br />
            <p>Math is a really hard topic for many people, and due to that it is among one of the least liked school subjects. Not only is it a hard in general, but it is taught usually in steps, meaning you have to know one thing in order to do the next. If at any point in ones' given education they miss out on a step or ignore it entirely, it can come back to bite them at higher level maths. This is also partially do to the school systems infrastructure, and how every math class requires that each student already knows all the math prior to it.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The premise of Math Explained is for the users to <a href="#" class="suggest">suggest</a> a math topic (e.g. fractions) to be explained, and eventually many topics will be covered. Furthermore, the style of teaching will try and be as beginner-friendly as possible, and will achieve that by answering a simple question that isn't asked enough in math classrooms around the world: Why? If the why is given, mathematics becomes substantially easier, when the why is given it makes its user feel like they themselves could've invented the math themselves, which in turn leads to an even greater understanding.</p>
