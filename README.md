# My Unfinished Projects
We've all had projects that we started and then one way or another, just stopped working on it. Hence, this repository. A place where I can put projects that I think the design and effort for what was completed is cool, but since it is not completed, it's obviously not deserving of a full project. Plus, it's always neat to look back and be able to see where you were at a given moment in time.

The rest of this README are descriptions about each project, according to my memory (as of writing this, most of these projects are 2-3 years old).

<b>Quick Note:</b> before reading on about each project, feel free to clone the repo and open any of the index.html files in a browser to view them.

## Calculator
<b>Inspiration:</b> The main point of this project was to learn HTML, CSS, and JS, and was one of my first ever projects. 

<b>Description:</b> This calculator is nearly fully complete from my testing, but does still have some weird behaviors. I'm pretty sure my plan was to have the previous command to be in gray on the second line, but never got around to completing that.

<b>Rating:</b> 7/10. I mean how low can you rate a semi-functional basic calculator? Although, I do like the design. Take notes, calculator app makers!

## CarDom (CarsDomain)
<b>Inspiration:</b> I've always found the inner workings of anything with an engine fascinating, especially cars. I wanted a way to report what I learned about cars in a blog series that from the home page, would allow users to easily navigate to a topic about anything in a car. A neat idea, not enough time in the world to continue my passion.

<b>Description:</b> A place where one goes to find out information about how their car works, whether that would be turbochargers, differences in engine shapes, or what shape of exhaust does what. From the home page, the only article I ever got to making can be found under Learn > Aspiration. The about page has a description, but never received any CSS styling.

<b>Rating:</b> 5/10. Pretty ugly if you scroll down from the home page. Article / blog format itself is pretty cool, but the footer is hideous.

## Delicacies
<b>Inspiration:</b> Me and one of my buddies started up an apparel company that sold hoodies with food-related designs on them, and we needed a website for it. We did make some hoodies, but quickly got pulled away by academic related matters, causing us to lose the time to maintain the company. 

<b>Description:</b> A website for others to be able to view our product, and possibly order some apparel. Every so often we would release a set of hoodies in a "drop," which followed a theme. The website could organize these drops on the homepage. Essential drop, breakfast drop, and many more were to come. The design of the website is really clean, although I wish I had some images put in of the actual hoodies, rather than stock images.

<b>Rating:</b> 9/10. The homepage (the only working page) is really clean. The hover effects and use of color is satisfying to look like. Sad to see this one unfinished. R.I.P Delicacies.

## Forza Auto Tune
<b>Inspiration:</b> Tuning cars in Forza Horizon games were always a tricky process, but had some mathematical reasoning behind them. I wanted a site where I could plug in the base values, along with the type of build (race, drift, offroad, drag), and it outputs the exact tune I should put on the car.

<b>Description:</b> If you're not familiar with Forza Horizon games, it's a relatively realistic racing game that allows for customization of many models of real world vehicles. Tuning cars may not be intuitive for everyone. Hence Forza Auto Tune. I only ever implemented the race auto tuning, but that was the main one I needed to do, since it could be really annoying to constantly plug values into a calculator.

<b>Rating:</b> 9/10. The website's homepage feel almost nostalgic to me, and I'm impressed at how simple yet good looking it is. The only other page, the tune page, has an easy to follow tutorial on how to tune your car, including pictures along the way.

## Math Explained
<b>Inspiration:</b> I wanted MathExplained to be a tool for me to help others. I tutored many people, and was also obsessed with 3b1b videos -- [shoutout Grant Sanderson](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) -- and wanted a website that could create graphics. I intended to learn Manim, a python animation tool that 3b1b used to produce his videos, and have a collection of topics so I could show the people I tutored how math worked. Or anyone who suggested anything on the "Suggest" page. The idea I think is great, and would have been useful, but I think it was too much work when people were already satisfied with my tutoring capabilities.

<b>Description:</b> I think my inspiration pretty well described what this website does, but it does have a nice home page. 10/10 "Learn" button.

<b>Rating:</b> 7/10. The homepage and the about page were the two pages I completed with this one, but both have entirely different designs. I can't tell if I hate that or not, but it probably is a bit confusing.

## Tic-Tac-Toe
<b>Inspiration:</b> No clue. It's Tic Tac Toe. I'm fairly confident I made this in one sitting in a free period in high school. I just put it here because eh, why not.

<b>Description:</b> Tic Tac Toe.

<b>Rating:</b> 5/10. It works... but it is literally just tic tac toe.
